# [Module 1] Horiseon Code Refactor
Codebase refactor to improve webpage:
- SEO
- Accessibility

## Description
This project was undertaken as part of a coding bootcamp. This was the first challenge exercise assigned by my professor. I was asked to refactor sample code by incorperating semantic elements, adding comments, and removing repetitions. Bringing code up to current standards is a common problem for many websites. This project provided me with practice using git to: methodically change HTML & CSS code as well as tracking, and committing changes to the code.

## Installation
